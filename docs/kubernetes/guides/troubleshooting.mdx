# Troubleshooting Operator Issues

## Describe Resources

You can use `kubectl describe` on the custom resources for the ngrok operator to check their statuses if they are not behaving properly or are not accessible.
This is a good first step

## Check Kuberentes Events

If something is not right with the operator you can check the events for the operator namespace.

```bash
kubectl get events -n ngrok-operator --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

Example Output:

```bash

:::tip
Kubernetes events usually expire after an hour, so you might want to restart the operator to re-create the events while troubleshooting if the events happened more than an hour ago.

## Check Operator Errors

To quickly check the operator logs for only errors, you can use a command such as the following. 
You can replace the name/namespace if you installed the operator somewhere other than the default location.

```bash
k logs -n ngrok-operator deploy/ngrok-operator-manager | grep "ERROR"
```

## Resources not getting deleted

If you marked an ngrok custom resource for deletion but it is not getting deleted, there may be unresolved finalizers on it. 
You can refer to the [finalizers page](/kubernetes/guides/finalizers) for more information about how the operator uses finalizers and how to clean up resources with dangling finalizers.

## Cloud endpoints not getting created from Ingress / Gateway API

If you're applying `Ingress` and/or Gateway API resources and do not see any `CloudEndpoint` or `AgentEndpoint` custom resources created by the operator, here are a few steps to identify the reason

### Ingress uses ngrok IngressClass?

### Gateway API uses the ngrok GatewayClass?

## Cloud endpoint not showing up on the dashboard

If you have `CloudEndpoint`

## Domain limits
