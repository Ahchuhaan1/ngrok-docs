# Managing Traffic with Redirects

Redirects allow you to seamlessly route users from one URL to another, ensuring they always reach the correct destination. They are commonly used for:
- 🔄 Preserving SEO rankings when URLs change.
- 🔐 Enforcing secure HTTPS connections.
- 🌍 Directing traffic to localized versions of a site.

✅ Gateway API natively supports redirect configuration, and this feature is fully supported by the ngrok Kubernetes operator. <br />
❌ Ingress resources do not have native redirect capabilities, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [redirect traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/redirect/).
