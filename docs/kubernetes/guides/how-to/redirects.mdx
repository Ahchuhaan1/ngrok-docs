## Redirect Examples

The following examples create an endpoint that redirects incoming requests from `/products` to `/store/products`

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<Tabs groupId="kind" queryString="kind">
	<TabItem value="agent-endpoint" label="AgentEndpoint" default>

	Check out the [redirect traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/redirect/) page for more details about how it functions and the parameters it accepts.

	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: AgentEndpoint
  metadata:
    name: example-agent-endpoint
  spec:
    url: https://example-agent-endpoint.ngrok.io
    upstream:
      url: http://my-service.my-namespace:8080
    trafficPolicy:
      inline:
        on_http_request:
          - actions:
              - type: redirect
                config:
                  from: /products
                  to: /store/products
	```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="cloud-endpoint" label="CloudEndpoint">

	Check out the [redirect traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/redirect/) page for more information about how to customize the parameters.

	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: CloudEndpoint
  metadata:
    name: example-cloud-endpoint
  spec:
    url: https://example-cloud-endpoint.ngrok.io
    trafficPolicy:
      policy:
        on_http_request:
          - actions:
              - type: redirect
                config:
                  from: /products
                  to: /store/products
	```
  </TabItem>
	<TabItem value="ingress" label="Ingress">
	üí° Ingress resources do not have native redirect capabilities, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [redirect traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/redirect/).

	Check out the [redirect traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/redirect/) page for more information about how to customize the parameters.

	### 1. Create an `NgrokTrafficPolicy`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: ngrok.k8s.ngrok.com/v1alpha1
  kind: NgrokTrafficPolicy
  metadata:
    name: example-tp
    namespace: default
  spec:
    policy:
      on_http_request:
        - actions:
            - type: redirect
              config:
                from: /products
                to: /store/products
	```

	### 2. Use the `NgrokTrafficPolicy` on an `Ingress`

	```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    annotations:
      k8s.ngrok.com/traffic-policy: example-tp
    name: example-ingress
    namespace: default
  spec:
    ingressClassName: ngrok
    rules:
      - host: example-ingress.ngrok.io
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: example-service
                  port:
                    number: 80
	```
  </TabItem>
	<TabItem value="gateway-api" label="Gateway API">
	‚úÖ Gateway API natively supports redirect configuration, and this feature is fully supported by the ngrok Kubernetes operator.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
