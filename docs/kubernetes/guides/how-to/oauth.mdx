# Securing Your Endpoints with OAuth Authentication

OAuth is a widely adopted authentication and authorization mechanism that enables users to securely access resources without exposing their credentials. It is commonly used for single sign-on (SSO), API security, and third-party integrations.

By enforcing OAuth authentication at the network edge, you can:

üîê Ensure only authorized users can access your services. <br />
‚ö° Offload authentication from your application, simplifying backend logic. <br />
üõ° Prevent unauthorized access by requiring valid OAuth tokens before forwarding requests. <br />


## üîç What are the Benefits of Using OAuth for Authentication?

OAuth allows applications to delegate authentication to a trusted identity provider (IdP), reducing the need for applications to handle passwords directly.
This enhances security, user experience, and compliance.

Key Benefits:

- **Secure Authentication:** Prevent unauthorized access with token-based authentication.
- **Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO):** Enable SSO across multiple services without requiring users to reauthenticate.
- **Supports Major Identity Providers:** Works with Google, Microsoft, GitHub, Okta, and other OAuth providers.
- **Improves Security & Compliance:** Helps meet security best practices like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).
- **Reduces Backend Complexity:** Authentication happens before requests reach your application, eliminating the need for custom auth logic.

<Tabs groupId="kind" queryString="kind">
	<TabItem value="agent-endpoint" label="AgentEndpoint" default>

	<TabItem value="cloud-endpoint" label="CloudEndpoint">
  </TabItem>
	<TabItem value="ingress" label="Ingress">
	‚ùå `Ingress` resources do not natively support OAuth enforcement, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [OAuth traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/).
  </TabItem>
	<TabItem value="gateway-api" label="Gateway API">
	‚ùå Gateway API resources do not natively support OAuth enforcement, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [OAuth traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/oauth/).
