# Managing TLS Termination for Secure Connections

When using Ingress and Gateway API resources with the ngrok Kubernetes operator, HTTPS endpoints are created by default, and ngrok automatically terminates TLS for secure traffic handling.

By customizing TLS termination settings, you can:

- üîê Use your own TLS certificates instead of ngrok-managed certificates.
- ‚ö° Enforce specific TLS versions for enhanced security.
- üîÑ Configure mutual TLS (mTLS) for bidirectional authentication between clients and your services.

‚úÖ Gateway API natively supports TLS termination, and this feature is fully supported by the ngrok Kubernetes operator.
‚ùå Ingress resources do not natively support advanced TLS termination options, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [terminate TLS traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/).

## üîç Why Customize TLS Termination?

TLS termination is essential for securing data in transit. Customizing TLS settings allows you to:

- Control certificate management, choosing between automatically provisioned or manually managed TLS certificates.
- Enforce strong encryption standards by restricting which TLS versions are accepted.
- Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) for client authentication, adding an extra layer of security.

Key Benefits:

- **Enhance Security:** Enforce TLS policies that comply with industry best practices.
- **Use Custom Certificates:** Deploy your own TLS certificates to meet security or compliance requirements.
- **Improve Client Authentication:** Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) to verify both server and client identities.
- **Ensure Compatibility:** Control TLS versions and cipher suites for secure connections.
- **Meet Compliance Standards:** Enforce encryption policies for HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2, and other security frameworks.
- Serve different certificates per domain in multi-tenant environments.
