# Protecting Services with Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a critical feature that prevents your services from being overwhelmed by excessive network traffic. By enforcing rate limits, you can control how many requests are allowed over a given period, helping to:

⚡ Maintain API performance by preventing excessive load.
🔐 Protect against abuse and malicious traffic.
🌍 Ensure fair usage across clients and users.

❌ `Ingress` and Gateway API resources do not natively support rate limiting, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [rate limit traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/rate-limit/).

## 🔍 Why Use Rate Limiting?

Without rate limiting, a single misconfigured client or a spike in traffic could easily overload your backend. 
Implementing rate limiting at the network edge helps prevent:
- API overuse and abuse (e.g., DDoS attacks, aggressive polling).
- Performance degradation for other users.
- Unexpected infrastructure costs due to excessive traffic.

Key Benefits:
- **Prevents Service Overload:** Ensures API stability even under high traffic.
- **Protects Against Automated Abuse:** Stops bots and scrapers from overwhelming services.
- **Ensures Fair Usage:** Distributes API resources evenly among users.
- **Reduces Infrastructure Costs:** Avoids unnecessary scaling due to excessive requests.
- **Improves Security & Compliance:** Helps meet API quotas and prevent brute-force attacks.
