# Securing Upstream Connections with TLS & Mutual TLS (mTLS)

If your upstream service requires encrypted TLS connections, you need to ensure that requests forwarded from the API Gateway are properly secured using TLS. 
Additionally, if your upstream service requires mutual TLS (mTLS), you can configure client certificates to authenticate both the API Gateway and the upstream service.

By configuring Upstream TLS and mTLS, you can:
- üîê Ensure end-to-end encryption between ngrok and your backend services.
- ‚ö° Authenticate API Gateway requests using client certificates.
- üöÄ Enforce stricter security policies for upstream service communication.

‚úÖ Gateway API natively supports upstream TLS configuration, and this feature is fully supported by the ngrok Kubernetes operator. <br />
‚ùå `Ingress` resources do not natively support advanced TLS termination options, so this option requires using Gateway API or the `AgentEndpoint` resources directly.

## üîç Why Use Upstream TLS & mTLS?

Securing upstream connections is essential for protecting sensitive data in transit, ensuring that API requests remain confidential and tamper-proof as they move between services.

Key Benefits:
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Protect sensitive data from client to backend using strong encryption.
- **Client Certificate Authentication:** Ensure only trusted API gateways can connect to your backend.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Access:** Block unauthorized requests by requiring valid client certificates.
- **Ensure Regulatory Compliance:** Meet security standards like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOC 2.
- **Enhance Service-to-Service Security:** Secure Kubernetes microservices using mTLS authentication.
