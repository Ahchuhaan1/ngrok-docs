# Securing Your Endpoints with JWT Validation

By validating JWTs at the network edge, you can:

üîí Ensure only authenticated users can access your services. <br />
‚ö° Reduce backend load by rejecting unauthorized requests early. <br />
üõ° Protect APIs from unauthorized access without modifying your upstream services. <br />

## üîç What are the Benefits of Validating JWTs?

JWTs are commonly used in OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and API authentication flows.

However, simply including a JWT in a request does not improve security. it must be verified to ensure:

- The token is properly signed by a trusted provider.
- The token has not expired.
- The token contains the correct claims (e.g., roles, permissions).

By performing JWT validation at the edge, you can offload authentication tasks from your backend and prevent unauthorized access before requests reach your service.

Key Benefits:

- **Enforcing Authentication:** Ensure only authenticated users can access protected resources.
- **API Security & Access Control:** Validate JWT claims to enforce role-based access (RBAC) or tenant restrictions.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO) Support:** Accept tokens from OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), or enterprise identity providers.
- **Reducing Backend Load:** Offload JWT validation to the edge, reducing unnecessary authentication checks.
