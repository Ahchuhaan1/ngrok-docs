# Controlling Traffic Flow with Request Routing

Request routing is the core capability of an API Gateway, enabling it to direct incoming traffic to the appropriate backend service.
By defining routing rules, you can control how requests are handled, which services they reach, and under what conditions.

Proper request routing ensures:

🚀 Optimized performance by directing traffic efficiently. <br />
🔄 Seamless service rollouts by routing requests based on versioning, headers, or user location. <br />
🛡 Enhanced reliability with failover and fallback mechanisms. <br />

## 🔍 What are the Benefits of Request Routing?

Modern applications often consist of multiple microservices that serve different functions.
A well-configured API Gateway can intelligently route traffic based on:

- Path-based rules (/api/v1/orders → Order Service, /api/v1/users → User Service).
- Header-based conditions (User-Agent: Mobile → Mobile Backend, User-Agent: Desktop → Web Backend).
- Query parameters & cookies (A/B testing, canary deployments).

Key Benefits:

- **Efficiently Direct Requests:** Ensure each request reaches the correct service, region, or version.
- **Enable Canary & Blue-Green Deployments:** Route a subset of traffic to new versions before full rollout.
- **Improve Scalability:** Load balance requests across multiple backend instances.
- **Enhance Security & Compliance:** Route traffic based on user identity, location, or authentication level.
- **Optimize Multi-Region Deployments:** Direct users to the nearest geographically distributed service.
