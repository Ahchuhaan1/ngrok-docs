# Improving Performance with Response Compression

Response compression reduces the size of HTTP response bodies sent from your upstream service, improving page load speeds, reducing bandwidth usage, and enhancing user experience.

When response compression is enabled:

- üìâ Data transfer sizes are reduced, lowering bandwidth consumption.
- ‚ö° Pages and APIs load faster, especially on slower networks.
- üöÄ Performance is improved without requiring changes to the upstream service.

‚ùå `Ingress` and Gateway API resources do not natively support response compression, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [compress response traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/compress-response/).

## üîç Why Use Response Compression?

Every millisecond counts when serving web applications and APIs.
Compression is a simple yet effective way to improve performance without modifying backend code.

Response Compression offers the following benefits:

- Faster Web & API Performance. Users receive responses quicker, reducing page load times.
- Compress JSON and XML payloads for faster API calls.
- Lower Bandwidth Usage. Ideal for high-traffic APIs, mobile users, and global applications.
- Better Client Experience. Reduces latency, especially in areas with slower network connections.
- Reduces bandwidth usage for users on slow or metered connections.
- No Backend Changes Needed. Compression is handled at the traffic policy level, requiring zero code modifications.
