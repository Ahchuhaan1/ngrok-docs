# Authenticating Users with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity verification protocol that allows users to securely sign in to applications using trusted identity providers (IdPs) such as Google, Microsoft, Okta, and Auth0.
OIDC is built on top of OAuth 2.0, adding an authentication layer that enables applications to verify user identities while also obtaining authorization tokens.

By enforcing OIDC authentication at the network edge, you can:

- üîê Ensure only authenticated users can access your services.
- ‚ö° Offload authentication to a trusted provider, simplifying backend logic.
- üõ° Enhance security by requiring identity verification before forwarding requests.

‚ùå `Ingress` and Gateway API resources do not natively support OIDC authentication, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [OIDC traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/oidc/).

## üîç Why Use OIDC for Authentication?

OIDC provides secure, standardized authentication that integrates seamlessly with modern identity providers.
It enables single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and user identity verification.

Key Benefits:

- **User Authentication & Identity Verification:** Verify who is accessing your service, not just what permissions they have.
- **Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allow users to sign in once and access multiple applications.
- **Supports Major Identity Providers:** Works with Google, Microsoft, Okta, Auth0, and other IdPs.
- **Enhances Security:** Enforces secure login flows, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and token-based verification.
- **Reduces Backend Complexity:** Authentication happens before requests reach your application, eliminating the need for custom auth logic.
