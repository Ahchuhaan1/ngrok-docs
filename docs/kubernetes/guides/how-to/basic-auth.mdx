# Securing Endpoints with Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication (Basic Auth) is a simple but effective way to restrict access to your services by requiring a valid username and password before allowing requests to reach your upstream service.

When Basic Authentication is enabled:
- üîê Requests without valid credentials are automatically rejected with a 401 Unauthorized response.
- üîê Only authenticated users can access your protected services.
- ‚ö° Authentication is enforced at the gateway level, reducing security overhead for your backend.

‚ùå `Ingress` and Gateway API resources do not natively support Basic Authentication, but they can be extended to take advantage of ngrok's [basic auth traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/basic-auth/).

## üîç Why Use Basic Authentication?

HTTP Basic Authentication is a simple yet effective way to restrict access to sensitive services without requiring complex identity providers or OAuth-based authentication systems. 

Key Benefits:
- Securing development or staging environments from public access.
- Adding a lightweight authentication layer when no other auth system is available.
- Protecting internal admin panels, dashboards, or API endpoints.
- Protect temporary or short-lived services without setting up an OAuth provider.


If you need more secure authentication methods for production traffic, consider the [OAuth](/kubernetes/guides/how-to/oauth), [OIDC](/kubernetes/guides/how-to/oidc), and [JWT Validation](/kubernetes/guides/how-to/jwt-validation) guides.
